Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place
 so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.


class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] arr) {
        int low = 0;
        int mid = 0;
        int high = arr.length - 1;
        int temp;
        while (mid<=high){
            switch (arr[mid]) {
                case 0 -> {
                    temp = arr[low];
                    arr[low] = arr[mid];
                    arr[mid] = temp;
                    low++;
                    mid++;
                }
                case 1 -> mid++;
                case 2 -> {
                    temp = arr[mid];
                    arr[mid] = arr[high];
                    arr[high] = temp;
                    high--;
                }
            }
        }
        
    }
}
